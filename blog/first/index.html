  <p>This is a the initial project in this site which is this site itself.</p>
<h1 id=""></h1>
<p>The whole site is created using the static site engine called Zola and I have went for a simple and minimilistic look. The look of this site is inspired form the site N-O-D-E.net .</p>
<h1 id="-1"></h1>
<p>My goal of this site is to write and list about my projects which I will be working on. All the projects which will be listed here may or may not be completed and the progress will be updated time to time.</p>
<h1 id="-2"></h1>
<p>And as I will be working on this site too, some changes may be expected.</p>
