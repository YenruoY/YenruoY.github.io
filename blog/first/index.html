  <p>So I recently got a server. And I am working on moving the whole site on that server. Moving the whole site will be easy. The problem is I don't have any domain name yet. I am planning to get one but not now</p>
  <p>The IP of that server is <a href="http://165.22.216.151">http://165.22.216.151</a>.</p>
  <p>Also the side don't have SSL certificate because I don't have any domain name.</p>

<div class="page_content">
  <p>This is a the initial project in this site which is this site itself.</p>
	<p></p>
<p>The whole site is created using the static site engine called Zola and I have went for a simple and minimilistic look. The look of this site is inspired form the site N-O-D-E.net .</p>
	<p></p>
<p>My goal of this site is to write and list about my projects which I will be working on. All the projects which will be listed here may or may not be completed and the progress will be updated time to time.</p>
	<p></p>
<p>And as I will be working on this site too, some changes may be expected.</p>
